# Algorithmic Toolbox at Coursera: Programming Challenges

## Sum of Two Digits Problem
_Compute the sum of two single digit numbers._

We start from this ridiculously simple problem to show you the pipeline of reading the problem statement, designing an algorithm, implementing it, testing and debugging your program, and submitting it to the grading system.

### Input
Two single digit numbers.

### Output
The sum of these numbers.

## Maximum Pairwise Product
_Find the maximum product of two distinct numbers in a sequence of non-negative integers._

### Input
A sequence of non-negative integers.

### Output
The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence.
